## Developing the app

You need a version of node with the harmony features available (> v0.11). Use something like [n](https://github.com/tj/n) to manage node version on you computer. For example.

```shell
$ npm install n
$ n latest
$ node --version
v0.11.14
```

To run the app in development.

```shell
$ npm run watch
```

Check out the scripts section of the `package.json` to see what this does.
